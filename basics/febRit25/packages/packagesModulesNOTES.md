# calling factorial and is prime from basic.py and advanced.py
# i have package inside package i have sub package(folder) inside that i have module (some logic codesfiles)
# inside that i have some modules  and from one modules to you are calling another modules
# to execute code in main.py by calling perticular functions 
# eg: just prime number or anycode by classname(utilities.folder.classname import primenumberfunction)

44:32 standard library (python)
pypi.org (you can create for your ORG also and store it here its call artidfactory also)
How to get packages developed by others (python)

#Standard library : when you install python you will get more modules default
#batteries included there are many functionality already install

# package unit of distribution in poython eg: if I want to share my code to you I will create package
 all of the open/community package are published to pypi
  pypi.org (every one share there code and packages/folder there will be sub folder and sub files/modules)

  pypi.org (you can create for your ORG also and store it here its call artifactory also)
  
  56:48 # To download packages we have to understand global and local packages
  Global package: entire systems(my system) level // its is applicable to everything
  Local : c drive local package (also with virtual package ) here I different  project and requirement is different to (eg: prepaid,vtc,decas not dendecy to each other all have different req)
  Every project has different versions
  
  Modules: 1: standard library, 2: custom developed, 3: third party modules
  Packages: Global: -> system wide, local: > project wide, virtual environment(environment specific to my project thatâ€™s the reason I will create virtual environment)
  
  To downlaod packages: pip, pipx,poetry

#The Python Standard Library is a collection of modules and packages that come bundled with Python, providing a wide range of functionality to simplify programming tasks. It eliminates the need to rewrite commonly used code by offering pre-written solutions for various operations. Here are the key features:
#Key Features of the Python Standard Library
#Built-in Modules: Includes modules written in C for system-level functionality (e.g., os for file and directory management, sys for system-specific parameters).
#Extensive Coverage: Offers modules for math operations (math), random number generation (random), string manipulation, data serialization (pickle), and more.
#Portability: Abstracts platform-specific differences into platform-neutral APIs, making Python programs portable across systems.
#Ease of Use: Modules can be imported directly into scripts to access their functionality.
#Commonly Used Modules
#os: Interact with the operating system.
#sys: Access system-specific parameters and functions.
#math: Perform mathematical operations.
#random: Generate random numbers.
#time: Work with time-related functions.
#re: Perform regular expression operations.
#socket: Handle low-level networking.
